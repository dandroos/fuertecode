services_intro: With over 20 years coding experience, I have acquired a wealth
  of knowledge to provide you with an expert service. Here are just some of the
  things I can build for you...
services:
  - service:
      service_heading: Websites and Web Apps
      service_icon: fas fa-globe
      service_body: From a basic blog to a large scale e-commerce site, I have you
        covered. I have experience with various languages and tech to be able to
        offer you the best advice to suit your goal(s) and budget. I design
        responsive web content, meaning that the design adapts to look great on
        mobile and desktop devices. I know how to optimise your site/app so that
        it loads and runs as fast as possible. I can also provide hosting and
        domain services/advice.
  - service:
      service_heading: Mobile Applications
      service_icon: fas fa-mobile
      service_body: Need a mobile app for your business, but don't know where to
        start? I create mobile applications using technology that works on both
        Android and iOS. This means that I don't have to write separate code for
        each operating system and therefore it halves the amount of work and,
        more importantly, cost! For some kinds of apps this isn't possible, but
        don't worry... I can also write native code to bring out the best of
        both operating systems. From design to deployment to app stores, I'll be
        there to guide you.
  - service:
      service_heading: Standalone Applications
      service_icon: fas fa-desktop
      service_body: I can build applications that run locally on your home/office
        computers. For example, perhaps you/your business would benefit from a
        bespoke invoicing and/or order fulfilment solution. It can have a pretty
        GUI (Graphical User Interface) or it can have a basic CLI (Command Line
        Interface). There are too many use cases for standalone applications to
        list here, but if you can think of a repetitive task you perform on your
        computer, there is a big possibility that it can be automated!

faqs:
  - faq:
      question: Where is your price list?
      answer: I don't have a price list because every project is unique and it is
        impossible to give you a quote without knowing your requirements. When I
        provide you with a quote, I separate labour and running costs (if
        applicable) so you can see exactly what you are paying for. I charge a
        fair rate for my services and I check my competitors prices regularly to
        ensure I am offering you the best price.
  - faq:
      question: How does payment work?
      answer: Similar to the process of many developers, I request half the total
        costs for the project before commencing work and the remainder upon
        completion (and of course, your satisfaction!).
  - faq:
      question: Am I protected?
      answer: Of course! We sign a contract for our mutual protection. Don't worry
        though, it is not a complicated contract and the basic gist is that you
        are legally fully protected from any 'shenanigans'....and so am I!
  - faq:
      question: Can you explain things to me without using jargon?
      answer: Yes. I don't expect everyone to know the ins and outs of development.
        That's why it is a specialist area and why you should hire a specialist
        to carry out the work! Some of the concepts of developing applications
        are abstract and so I like to explain the processes using analogies
        (usually restaurant analogies!). That said, if you'd rather not know how
        it works, I completely understand and respect that too!
  - faq:
      question: Are you contactable by phone?
      answer: I am, but please bear in mind that I may not be able to answer your call
        immediately. The reason being that writing code requires focus so I put
        my phone on silent when I am working. If you leave a message, I will
        call you back as soon as I see it. I check my phone intermittently
        through the day and I have a number you can call in case of emergencies.
  - faq:
      question: How often will I receive progress updates?
      answer: At the end of every working day, I will send you a progress report so
        that you can stay up-to-date on where I am with your project.
  - faq:
      question: What is the first step?
      answer: Please [get in touch](/contact) and provide me with as many details
        about what you need for your project. It doesn't need to be technical or
        have lots of detail. I will respond as soon as possible with a quote or
        a request for further information in order to give you a more accurate
        quote. There is absolutely no obligation and I do not pressure potential
        clients after quoting them. Once you have the quotation, the ball is in
        your court to ask further questions or give the green light!
  - faq:
      question: My question isn't listed...
      answer: No worries! [Contact me](/contact) and I will happily answer it for you!
