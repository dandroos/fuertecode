      service_body:
        From a basic blog to a large scale e-commerce site, I have you
        covered. I have experience with various languages and tech to be able to
        offer you the best advice to suit your goal(s) and budget. I design
        responsive web content, meaning that the design adapts to look great on
        mobile and desktop devices. I know how to optimise your site/app so that
        it loads and runs as fast as possible. I can also provide hosting and
        domain services/advice.

      service_icon: "fas fa-mobile"
      service_body: Need a mobile app for your business, but don't know where to
        start? I create mobile applications using technology that works on both
        Android and iOS. This means that programmers don't have to write
        separate codebases and therefore it halves the amount of work. For some
        kinds of apps this isn't possible, but don't worry... I can also write
        native code to bring out the best of both operating systems. From design
        to deployment to app stores, I'll be there to guide you.

      service_heading: Standalone Applications
      service_icon: "fas fa-desktop"
      service_body:
        I can build applications that run locally on your home/office
        computers. For example, perhaps you/your business would benefit from a
        bespoke invoicing and/or order fulfilment solution. It can have a pretty
        GUI (Graphical User Interface) or it can have a basic CLI (Command Line
        Interface). There are too many use cases for standalone applications to
        list here, but if you can think of a repetitive task you perform on your
        computer, there is a big possibility that it can be automated!

      question: Where is your price list?
      answer:
        I don't have a price list because every project is unique and it is
        impossible to give you a quote without knowing your requirements. When I
        provide you with a quote, I separate labour and running costs (if
        applicable) so you can see exactly what you are paying for. I charge a
        fair rate for my services and I check my competitors prices regularly to
        ensure I am offering you the best price.
