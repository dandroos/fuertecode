  Hi! My name is Dave! I am an Englishman fast-approaching middle age(!) and I have
  been living happily on Fuerteventura (one of the Canary Islands) for the past few
  years. When I am not in front of a computer, I am usually volunteering at my
  local dog rescue centre. I enjoy hanging out with, and taking photos of, all
  the dogs! I am also an amateur musician and enjoy playing the piano to unwind.


  I am a freelance software developer. For web work, I primarily working with React and Gatsby. However, I have experience with other languages and tech, such as Python, PHP, Go, Electron, WordPress, Django, Laravel and more!

        If photos of dogs are your thing, then this is the place! I
        sometimes post about my work here, but lovely rescue doggies make for
        much better photos!

        GitHub is a code repository. If you would like to see examples
        of my work, here is where you will find them. You'll also get a glimpse
        at what the code looks like 'under the hood'!

        I tend to use Facebook for marketing purposes only, so not
        much to see here! That said, if you would like to follow and share my
        page, I would be very grateful!
